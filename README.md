# Hero-Duels-Discord-Bot
This Discord bot was created to facilitate and allow users to play the card game "Hero Duels," a Dungeons and Dragons-like 
game written by Chance Gowen of the Basically Good Podcast. It was a commission that fell through after the show ended, 
but the game was nearly completed.

## Description
This card game plays very similarly to an abbreviated version of the game Pathfinder, a game similar to Dungeons and Dragons.
Once two players agree to duel, the two players choose a card to play that they own. Then the duel begins!
They roll for initiative, and begin taking turns and performing actions specific to their character or otherwise until one player
is victorious! 

## Incomplete Features
As this project was canceled, there are unfinished features I would have liked to add. They are as follows:
  - An automated way to give new cards to players.
  - A currency system for players to use for purchasing cards, upgrades, and bet on other duels.
  - An adaptive **!help** function which tells the user what actions are immediately available to them.
  - Rarity boosts and Tournament settings
  - Robust testing from beta testers.
